## **What Problem does this solve and how was a solution accomplished?**

Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles users’ financial information. The app will use mongoose and indexedDB from the previous module because to be a successful developer, you must be able to formulate a solution by synthesizing knowledge that you’ve picked up from previous experience.

## **What makes this project stand out?**

<br/>

## **Challenge Criteria**

AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection<br/>

-   WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit<br/>
    THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit

-   WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection<br/>
    THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
